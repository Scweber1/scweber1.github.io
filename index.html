    <h1>My name is Sarah Weber.</h1>
    <p>I am an aspiring UX Designer, studying web and UX Design 
        at Wake Tech. I previously worked in Digital Marketing 
        and am hoping to make a career change. I love the blend 
        of creative and analytical thinking that goes into being 
        an effective UX designer. </p>
    <p>Although I am new to it, I really enjoy coding. In a past 
        project for my undergraduate degree, I coded a visual novel. 
        It was incredibly fun and easy to lose myself in the work.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy a variety of things. I am an avid runner,
        wonderful in the kitchen, enjoy motorcycles and am learning 
        how to scuba dive. I enjoy staying busy and learning new things.</p>
