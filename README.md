# 1. Name: Sarah Weber Email: scweber1@my.waketech.edu 

# 2. I created this GitHub account today. I had another account many years ago for another class, but it has been so long that I have a lot to be refreshed on. With my Github account, I am able to host and collaborate on code-related projects. This gives me the ability to show development work, track project versions, and contribute to open-source communities. 

# 3. The repository I created was made for the Lesson 05 Lab, which was intended to teach students to use Github Desktop to clone a Github Pages repository, add their website files to the local repository folder, commit their changes, push their changes to Github, and successfully publish a website at the designated Github Pages URL. This repository contains the changes that I made to the README file, which includes all the answers to the required questions, including my name, a description of my Github account, a description of the repository I created, and a brief description of the steps I took to clone the repository on my local machine. 

# 4. I accomplished this task through following the steps detailed in the assignment, which were all straightforward and easy to follow. This began by creating a Github account as well as downloading Github Desktop. I went through the correct motions to create a new repository, named the repository, and cloned it. I saved this clone to a folder on my computer that I would be able to easily locate again in the future. Through Github Desktop, I was able to take the changes that I made to this file, commit those changes, and then push the file.
